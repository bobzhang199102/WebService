# WebService
Implement a web service.
Support a REST GET call.
 a. The web service accepts a number, n, as input and returns the first n Fibonacci numbers, starting from 0. I.e. given n = 5, appropriate output would represent the sequence "0 1 1 2 3".
 b. Given a negative number, it will respond with an appropriate error.
